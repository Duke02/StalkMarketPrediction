# Stalk Market Prediction
This repository is for predicting the stalk market within Nintendo's game "Animal Crossing: New Horizons".
The script provides several regression models to predict future turnip prices.

## Credits
A lot of this code would not exist without help from 
[this website and the accompanying book.](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
I personally highly recommend this book, as it gives several code samples that 
have proven immensely useful in launching specific predictors and
for teaching the models immensely well. His code is licensed under the 
[MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

(Some code was taken from this site and may or may not have been modified to fit my needs.)
